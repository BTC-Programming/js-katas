/* INSTRUCTIONS for PART 1 */

// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.
// 3. Embed equation in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".
// 4. Get Manual Input for "totalQuestions" (e.g. 10).
// 5. Embed all code in a For loop and run it totalQuestions times.

/* REFACTOR INTO FUNCTION */

// 6. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice, and call multiPractice within the For loop.
// 7. If a wrong answer was submitted on a question, return 1 from multiPractice and add to variable called wrongAnswers.
// 8. At "stop" or loop end, report # answers wrong.  If wrongAnswers = 0, say "Charlie, you've won!"
