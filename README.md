1.1 - Conditionals with Prompt

Instructions

	Prompt for a flavor "What flavor scoop?", then show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop"
	Use conditional logic to check responses where flavor is not equal to chocolate or vanilla:
		If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry"
		Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]"
	For fun, add other conditionals and responses. 

1.2 - While Loop

Instructions

	Conditional where flavor = chocolate or vanilla
	Begin with flavor = "start"
	Use a While Loop to accept flavors unless flavor = "done"
	Prompt for flavor, then output "here's your" + flavor
		If strawberry, alert "all out of strawberry"
		Else alert "no such flavor"
	If flavor equal to "done", alert "Enjoy!"
	Hint: don't use an "else" without a condition in the loop!
