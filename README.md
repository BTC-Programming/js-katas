1.1 - Conditionals with Prompt

Instructions

	Prompt for a flavor "What flavor scoop?", then show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop"
	Use conditional logic to check responses where flavor is not equal to chocolate or vanilla:
		If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry"
		Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]"
	For fun, add other conditionals and responses. 

1.2 - While Loop

Instructions

	Conditional where flavor = chocolate or vanilla
	Begin with flavor = "start"
	Use a While Loop to accept flavors unless flavor = "done"
	Prompt for flavor, then output "here's your" + flavor
		If strawberry, alert "all out of strawberry"
		Else alert "no such flavor"
	If flavor equal to "done", alert "Enjoy!"
	Hint: don't use an "else" without a condition in the loop!

1.3 - For Loop

Instructions

	This is for a three-scoops sundae, so you'll use a loop. 
	Prompt for a flavor by scoop number
	Use conditional logic to check responses where flavor is not equal to chocolate or vanilla
		If scoop is in stock, show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop"
		If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry."
		Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]."
		Allow selecting another flavor if not in stock -- don't deprive user of scoops!

1.4 - Arrays and a Function

Instructions

	We are building a sundae with scoops, so you need an array for the scoops, called flavors 
	We are checking flavor requests against flavors in stock, so you need an array called ourFlavors
	This is for a three-scoops sundae, so you'll use a loop. 
	Prompt for each flavor by scoop number
	Use a function called inArray to check if the requested flavor is in stock
	If scoop is in stock, show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop"
	Use conditional logic for addtional options. 
		If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry."
		Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]."
		Allow selecting another flavor -- don't deprive user of scoops!
