# Guessing Game

2.1 Basic
	0. Use the Math function to pick a random number between 1 and 100, and round it to an integer.
	1. Show the answer in the console (to speed up testing) until the program works, then disable it.
	2. Initialize variables for number of turns, Correct (boolean)
	3. Start counting turns
	4. Use a while loop to check if the Correct is true.
	5. Prompt for a guess
	6. If the guess is equal to the answer, say how many turns it took.
	7. If the guess is too high or low, give feedback and add to turns.
	8. When the game is over, thank the player for playing.

2.2 Play Again and Average

	1. Give the player an option to play again.
	2. After each win, show the number of games played, and average of turns across games.

2.3 Functions and Quit
	1. Recode in two functions, one for game play and one for play again.
	2. Check if the guess is a number.  If it isn't, cancel play.

2.4 Use the DOM
	1. Situate the game within a web page
	2. Use input boxes and a submit button rather than the console

2.5 Fancy DOM
	1. Use CSS to clean up the game display
	2. Display the various games and turns somewhere.
	3. Display the number and games and average somewhere.
