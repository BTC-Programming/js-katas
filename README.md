1.1 - Conditionals with Prompt

Instructions

	Prompt for a flavor "What flavor scoop?", then show an alert with "Here's your [flavor] scoop"
	Use conditional logic to check responses where flavor is not equal to chocolate or vanilla:
		If strawberry, alert "Sorry, we're all out of strawberry"
		Else alert "Sorry, we don't carry [flavor]"
	For fun, add other conditionals and responses. 

NOTE: Unlike most GitHub projects, each branch is a SEPARATE SET OF KATAS.  Do not initiate merge requests.
