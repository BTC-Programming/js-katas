// 1. Print 2 Random Integers, X & Y, each between 3 and 9, as a soluble equation:  X * Y = ??
// 2. Receive manual input for solution, say "Correct!" if match, "Incorrect!" if not.
// 3. Embed equation in While loop that continues until entry matches solution, or = "stop".

// 1. Embed all code in a For loop that runs 10 times.
// 2. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice, and call multiPractice within the For loop.
// 3. Count how many not-right-first-answers and return that count from multiPractice.
// 4. Accept manual input for loop (not 10 but "questions") and calculate percent correct first time. 
// 5. At "stop" or at loop end, report answer percent correct.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"
