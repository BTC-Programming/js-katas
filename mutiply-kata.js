// 1. Embed all code in a For loop that runs 10 times.
// 2. Move code parts 1-3 into a function called multiPractice, and call multiPractice within the For loop.
// 3. Count how many not-right-first-answers and return that count from multiPractice.
// 4. Accept manual input for loop (not 10 but "questions") and calculate percent correct first time. 
// 5. At "stop" or at loop end, report answer percent correct.  If no wrong answers, say "Charlie, you've won!"
